            <h1>Capstone Project</h1>
            <h2>Project Date: October 2015 - April 2016</h2>
            <h2>Class Name: Web Design</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/capstone.png" alt="My website that I made for Capstone" class="senImg"/>
            <h3>About:</h3>
              <p>For this project, the class split up into groups of two to three people and were in charge of creating a website to help solve an issue in the community. This was a year long project, and once finished would be presented at a gallery walk on Capstone night.</p>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
              <p>This project was the test to see just how much my group and I knew about web designing and coding. My group decided to create a website to help solve inequality and hate, called Equal Identity, which shared stories from those who have been negatively affected based on gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, etc. I all around enjoyed this project even after all the hardship and difficulties my group and I had to face in the process. I was the only person in my group who was really proficient in coding, so I was forced to do all the coding, which was very stressful, but at the same time was somsething I thoroughly enjoyed. My team was also not very proficient in designing, and we all worked together to come up with the design, which I still feel isn't the best it could be, but it is the hardest we tried and I am proud of it. This website, along with the presentation ended up turning out a lot better than I originally imagined it to, and overall, I'm proud with both my team, and myself for the end product of this capstone.</p>

            <h1>Capstone Essay</h1>
            <h2>Project Date: April 2016</h2>
            <h2>Class Name: English 12 Honors</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/capstoneEssay.png" alt="My capstone essay that I worked on." class="senImg"/>
            <h3>About:</h3>
              <p>The capstone essay was an essay that was a summary of everything each student did for their capstone project, detailing the whole process, the end result, and individual reflections.</p>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
              <p>I did not like this project at all. This wasn't a very hard project for me to do, and overall it was very easy, but it just didn't feel worthwhile. It felt like a complete waste, especially after all the work I had put into my capstone. It was supposed to detail my project and everything like that, but I feel that just looking at the website I had created for my capstone should have been a good enough example of what my capstone was like, and was only useful for the reflection. Overall, an easy assignment that I see no point in.</p>

            <h3>About:</h3>
              <p>Studio C is a web design company ran by the senior web class, that builds websites for clients, and splits the class into different departments to work on each project. The different departments are coding, design, testing, content, and marketing. Each department is in charge of a specific job for each website.</p>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
              <p>Being a part of a web design company and full on web design team was an amazing experience, and even though it was for school, I really enjoyed it. I was a part of the coding department, something I was surprised by, seeing that I'm not a very good coder in the first place, but I saw it as the perfect opportunity to learn. I was able to work on all of my assignments for this team diligently, managing to keep up even for the few days I was absent. I was able to learn so much from this, from Wordpress, to flexbox, to even some stuff about app development. Even though there were some times where the process was very disorganized, I feel that being a part of Studio C was an incredible experience and helped me realize that website development is something I can consider going into if I decide to take it seriously.</p>
