            <h3>About:</h3>
              <p>For this project, the class split up into groups of two to three people and were in charge of creating a website to help solve an issue in the community. This was a year long project, and once finished would be presented at a gallery walk on Capstone night.</p>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
              <p>This project was a disaster at first for me. Me and my partner decided to split this up by having one person do the HTML, CSS and create the questions, while the other person did all of the Javascript coding. I chose to do the Javascript coding because I had a better understanding of it than my partner did, and it went downhill from there. I used what I learned and did a lot of searching around to learn how to randomize questions and answers and display which were right and wrong. I ended up having over 900 lines of code that still didn’t completely work before I decided the night before to completely start over. After starting over and stressing throughout the night, I managed to get the code to work, and it was an amazing feeling to know this. The presentation went very good as well. This assignment taught me a lot about Javascript, but mostly taught me that it’s okay to start over and not be afraid to take that risk.</p>

            <h1>Writing Skills</h1>
            <h1>Capstone Essay</h1>
            <h2>Project Date: April 2016</h2>
            <h2>Class Name: English 12 Honors</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/capstoneEssay.png" alt="My capstone essay that I worked on." class="senImg"/>
            <h3>About:</h3>
              <p>The capstone essay was an essay that was a summary of everything each student did for their capstone project, detailing the whole process, the end result, and individual reflections.</p>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
              <p>This project was new and foreign ground for me. I had vague knowledge on the Salem Witch Trials and HUAC Committee from what my teacher had told us, and from the Crucible. This vague knowledge lead to a lot of research to learn about the subject. This was also my first ever group essay, so splitting up the sections for each person was also a difficult task to decide, but we overcame this obstacle. This was probably the most writing I had done for an essay and the most informative essay I have done. It was very stressful and not very enjoyable, but the outcome was worth it. I learned how to create a group essay, and hope to become better at such.</p>

            <h3>About:</h3>
              <p>Studio C is a web design company ran by the senior web class, that builds websites for clients, and splits the class into different departments to work on each project. The different departments are coding, design, testing, content, and marketing. Each department is in charge of a specific job for each website.</p>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
              <p>This project was a lot of fun for me and my group members. It gave us the opportunity to showcase our creative skills while at the same time persuade a certain audience to believing a certain opinion. My group first drew out the poster and colored it all on just paper as a sort of basis for the poster. After we had done this, we went along with using the popagraph app and I feel the result was very nice. The popagraph app at first was quite confusing to use, and we had some trouble because we had a few class periods to work on this, but we couldn’t work on it the first period we had. We couldn’t work because of the school Wi-Fi being a bit inconsistent and the app wouldn’t download. We eventually overcame this and managed to finish it. It taught me how to be versatile in a variety of different apps and how you need backup plans.</p>
